Color blindness comes in different varieties. The lesson we should learn from all of them though is that we shouldn't use color to convey meaning. Or if we do, provide a method to gain that meaning through other means. An example that may be provided is that we could use an alt tag of an image to describe the colors on a map. A better approach would be to have a caption for the image. I say this because a vision user with color blindness won't immediately look for an alt tag. Also we can use shapes to differentiate things and their meaning. Like making a main button bigger instead of just giving it a more intense color. And when using graphics, keep in mind that people may not be able to easily differentiate the colors. So use shapes inside the graphs to differentiate their meaning in addition to color.
