It is important to understand that people with low vision, color blindness, or even just bad hardware for viewing need us as web developers to provide them with the tools to understand our sites. One of the things we can do is to ensure that the contrast between our text and background is such that even someone with black and white vision could see it. Web Content Accessibility Guidelines have set up a formula for us to determine the contrast ratio of our colors. There are various tools, such as WebAIM Color Contrast, we can use. There are also browser plugins, such as WAVE, which will scan a page and notify us of any failing colors. Finally there are javascript libraries that can take in two colors and return the contrast ratio which we can then use to determine if our contrast is high enough. It is also worth noting that the contrast ratio required is different for large and small text. Small text is defined as 14 point or 16-17px. and large is 18 point or about 24px or bigger.

Along with contrast we should also recognize that links should not use color to differentiate them. Despite standards that links are typically blue, that color could be used anywhere. Also there are some people who can struggle to see the color or know that the color means a link. Instead we rely upon underlines, icons, and dotted lines surrounding an element to indicate interactions.
